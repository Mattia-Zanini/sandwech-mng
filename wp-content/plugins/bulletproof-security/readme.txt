= BulletProof Security htaccess File Options (Firewalls, etc.) Features =

<strong>Description:</strong> WordPress Website Security Protection: .htaccess files (distributed Server configuration files) are processed by your server first before any other code on your website. In other words, hackers malicious scripts are stopped by BulletProof Security .htaccess files/Firewalls before those scripts even have a chance to reach the php code in WordPress. BulletProof Security protects your website against 100,000's of different hacking attempts/attacks. The .htaccess security filters in BulletProof Security are designed to match malicious and nuisance attack patterns. The most important benefits of using a finite pattern matching method vs infinite banning/blocking individual IP's, Host's, Referer's, etc. is that your website performance and Server resources are not negatively impacted. In general, BulletProof Security takes an "Action Approach" to website security. Hacker X, Spammer X, Bad Bot X does bad Action Y = Forbidden/Blocked. An "Action Approach" is a much more effective and performance optimized approach to website security since the bad action itself is being blocked/forbidden instead of attempting to block an individual hacker/spammer that performed a bad action. Example: BulletProof Security blocks all SQL Injection hacking attempts/attacks no matter who (IP Address, hostname, Bot name, etc.) performed the SQL Injection hacking attempt/attack. See the BulletProof Security Login Security & Monitoring Features section for additional features and options. See the BulletProof Security htaccess File Options (Firewalls, etc.) Features section for additional features and options.

<strong>Description:</strong> MScan is a malware scanner that scans website files for hacker files or code and scans the WP database for hacker code. MScan Scheduled 
scanning is available in BPS Pro only.

All other non-WP files are scanned using standard conventional pattern matching. Now that WP Files are all scanned with file hash comparisons this allowed increasing the detection sensitivity for pattern matching scanning. Additional pattern matching rules have been added to MScan.

= BulletProof Security is Website Performance Optimized =

Website performance is just as important as website security. BulletProof Security is website performance optimized with website owners best interests at heart. BulletProof Security does NOT abuse the WordPress Database by making excessive MySQL Queries. BulletProof Security does NOT store excessive & non-essential data in your WordPress Database. BulletProof Security does NOT use excessive Server Memory & Resources. BulletProof Security does NOT use any gimmicks or bells & whistles that will cost website owners their website performance. The benefits of having website security protection are negated if your website is performing poorly/slowly, continually experiencing out of memory errors/running out of memory, database size growing exponentially with non-essential stored data, etc. BulletProof Security can actually speed up & improve your website performance by using the Speed Boost Cache Bonus Code. See the BulletProof Security Bonus Custom Code help section below.

= Can BulletProof Security be Network Activated on Network|Multisite Sites? =

The BulletProof Security plugin can be Network Activated or you can allow BulletProof Security to be activated individually on each Network/Multisite subsite or of course you can choose not to Network Activate BulletProof Security or allow the BPS plugin on subsites. Super Admins will see BPS Dashboard Alerts and other Status displays on the Primary Site only. Administrators can activate or deactivate BulletProof Security on subsites if you allow this on your Network/Multisite website. The BPS Primary Site Menus will display all BPS menus. The BPS Subsite Menus will display: Login Security, JTC-Lite, Maintenance Mode, System Info & UI|UX Theme Skin menus. All BulletProof Security features are not available on subsites since Network/Multisite subsites are virtual and do not have physical website folders. All BulletProof Security features work sitewide and affect all other virtual subsites. Login Security and Maintenance Mode work independently on each subsite. 

* The BPS Setup Wizard Options page contains these two Network/Multisite options: Network|Multisite Sitewide Login Security Settings and Network|Multisite Sitewide JTC-Lite Settings, which allow you to bulk setup all subsites with default JTC-Lite option settings.
* Login Security works individually for each specific subsite. Login Security has all the same functionality on Network/Multisite subsites with these exceptions: Login Security email alerting is not available for subsites.
* JTC-Lite works individually for each specific subsite. JTC-Lite has all the same functionality on Network/Multisite subsites.
* Maintenance Mode works individually for each specific subsite. MMode has all the same functionality on Network/Multisite subsites with these exceptions: BackEnd Maintenance is not available on subsites & these Primary site options are not available on subsites: Put The Primary Site And All Subsites In Maintenance Mode & Put All Subsites In Maintenance Mode, But Not The Primary Site.
* System Info has all the same functionality on Network/Multisite subsites with these exceptions: MySQL Database information is not displayed on subsites. 
* BulletProof Security also works with Network/Multisite Domain Mapping.

= BulletProof Security Built-in Troubleshooting|Diagnostic|Logging|Whitelisting =

Troubleshooting|Diagnostic|Logging|Whitelisting is built-in to BulletProof Security. BPS troubleshooting steps: <a href="https://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/topic/read-me-first-free/#bps-free-general-troubleshooting" title="BPS Troubleshooting Steps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BPS Troubleshooting Steps</a>. The Setup Wizard performs Pre-Installation Checks to check for any pre-existing issues that could cause any issues or problems and displays exactly what needs to be done to fix the issue. The Setup Wizard has a built-in feature called AutoFix that automatically creates known fixes for 100+ Plugins and Themes. The BPS Security Log logs blocked hackers, spammers, bad bots, etc. and also logs anything else that is blocked by BPS. If something legitimate is being blocked in another plugin or theme that needs to be allowed/whitelisted then the BPS Security Log entry will contain all the information about what exactly is being blocked so that a whitelist rule can then be created in BPS Custom Code. The BPS Security Log also logs all other 403 errors that occur on your website whether or not they are related to or caused by BPS. Turning Off BPS Security Logging will allow your server to handle error logging and display your server error message instead of BPS displaying the standard 403 template file error message. This is also considered a troubleshooting method to determine if an error is actually coming from your server (ModSecurity, etc.) and not the BPS plugin.

= I am seeing Security Log entries in my BulletProof Security Log. What do they mean? =

Your Security Log will log 400, 403, 405, 410 and 404 (requires copying the BPS 404 logging code to your Theme's 404.php Template) Errors. The Security Log logs all 400, 403, 405  and 410 HTTP Response Status Codes by default. You can also log 404 HTTP Response Status Codes by opening this BPS 404 Template file - /bulletproof-security/404.php and copying the logging code into your Theme's 404 Template file. When you open the BPS 404.php file you will see simple instructions on how to add the 404 logging code to your Theme's 404 Template file. 99.99% of what is logged in the Security Log is blocked hackers, spammers, bad bots, scrapers, miners, etc. The Security Log is also a troubleshooting tool. If BPS is blocking something legitimate in another plugin or theme then exactly what is being blocked in another plugin or theme by BPS will be logged in the Security Log. A whitelist rule can be created to allow anything legitmate that is being blocked in another plugin or theme.

= HTTP Status Codes (Internet Standard) =

* 400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the Server due to malformed syntax.
* 401 Unauthorized - The request requires user authentication. By default BPS redirects Auth Requests to the correct URI to avoid 404 errors.
* 403 Forbidden - The Server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
* 404 Not Found - The Server has not found anything matching the Request-URI/URL. No indication is given to whether the condition is temporary or permanent.
* 405 Method Not Allowed - The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource identified by the Request-URI. The response MUST include an Allow header containing a list of valid methods for the requested resource. BPS blocks HEAD Requests using a 405 ErrorDocument Redirect. The BPS 405 Template has an Allow header field for the GET, POST and PUT HTTP Methods.
* 410 Gone - The requested resource is no longer available at the Server/site and no forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be considered permanent.
* 503 Service Unavailable - The Server/site is temporarily performing maintenance. Used in BPS MMode with Retry-After header to indicate when the Server/site will be available again.

= Will BulletProof Security or .htaccess files or .htaccess code cause my website to run slower? =

No. BulletProof Security or .htaccess files/code in general will not cause a website to run slower. BulletProof Security is website performance optimized and uses very little/low website resources and very little Server memory. BulletProof Security uses a finite number of security rules/filters/code in all .htaccess files. Note: Both W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache use .htaccess code to speed up website performance.

= Can BulletProof Security speed up my website and make it run faster? =

Yes. BulletProof security can speed up your website and make it run faster if you use the <a href="https://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/topic/htaccess-caching-code-speed-boost-cache-code/" title="BPS Speed Boost Cache Code">BPS Speed Boost Cache Code</a> and add it to BPS Custom Code.

= Do I need to understand .htaccess code in order to use BulletProof Security? =

No. We use a paint by numbers approach, have extensive documented help and fixes on our Forum site and provide exact steps to perform any tasks that need to be done such as adding whitelist rules or other custom code. ie do Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. BPS creates customized .htaccess files for your website by either running the Setup Wizard or clicking the BulletProof Modes Activate buttons. You do not need to know anything about .htaccess website security files or code in order to use the BulletProof Security plugin. Extensive help information can be found in the Question Mark help buttons in BPS. The Help & FAQ tab pages in BulletProof Security contain links to BulletProof Security Forum help topics and video tutorials. The process of adding Custom Code or adding whitelisting rules is automated - See the Custom Code Question Mark help button for Custom Code steps.

= Are there any known issues or conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Occasionally issues or conflicts do occur with other plugins, but they are always quickly resolved. BulletProof Security is compatible with all other Plugins and Themes. If BulletProof Security is blocking something legitimate in another plugin or theme a whitelist rule can be created in BPS Custom Code to allow/whitelist whatever was being blocked by BPS. Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="https://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/topic/plugin-conflicts-actively-blocked-plugins-plugin-compatibility/" title="Plugin Compatibility" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility</a> page for the steps to search for documented plugin or theme whitelist rules.

= How do the BulletProof Security Plugin htaccess File Options (Firewalls) work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin allows you to create and activate .htaccess website security with one-click (literally if the BPS Setup Wizard is run) (figuratively if you are using BPS manual controls) for your website without having to know anything about .htaccess files. The Master .htaccess files are pre-made and BPS writes additional .htaccess code that is customized to each specific website when you run the Setup Wizard or if you use the Manual Controls. There is nothing to figure out or to configure. Either run the Setup Wizard or use the Manual Setup Controls: BulletProof Modes Activate buttons. BPS has built-in Backup and Restore and an .htaccess File Editor for full manual editing control as well. BPS Custom Code allows you to add additional custom .htaccess code or BPS Bonus Custom Code and save it permanently so that your saved code is added/created in your htaccess files.

= How does BulletProof Security Plugin Login Security & Monitoring work? =

BulletProof Security Login Security & Monitoring allows you to choose whether you want to Log All User Account Logins or Log Only User Account Lockouts. The Dynamic DB Logging Form has 3 checkbox options: Lock, Unlock or Delete database rows. The Login Security database table is hooked into the WordPress Users database table, but they are 2 completely separate database tables. If you lock a User Account then BPS will enforce that lock on that User Account and the User will not be able to log in. If you unlock a User Account then the User will be able to login. Deleting database rows in the Login Security database table does NOT delete the User Account from the WordPress Users database table. When you delete a User Account it is pretty much the same thing as unlocking a User Account. To delete actual User Accounts you would go to the WordPress Users page and delete that User Account.

= What to do if your User Account is locked by Login Security out and you are unable to login? =

Use FTP or your web host control panel file manager and rename the /bulletproof-security/ plugin folder name to /_bulletproof-security and login to your website. After logging into your website, rename the /_bulletproof-security/ plugin folder name back to /bulletproof-security/. Unlock your User Account on the BPS Login Security and Monitoring page.

= What to do if you cannot log back into your website due to an htaccess file/code problem? =

If you accidentally added additional invalid custom htaccess code to BPS Custom Code or your web host does not allow you to lock your root .htaccess file and your htaccess file was locked: Use FTP or your Web Host Control Panel File Manager and delete the .htaccess files that BPS creates in your website root folder and your wp-admin folder. Deleting the .htaccess files in your website root folder & wp-admin folder will allow you to log back in to your website. If your web host does not allow locking the root .htaccess file then go to htaccess File Editor tab page and click the Turn Off AutoLock button. Either run the Setup Wizard again or click the BulletProof Modes Activate buttons again. If the problem was caused by invalid custom htaccess code added to BPS Custom Code then remove/delete the invalid custom htaccess code from BPS Custom Code before activating BulletProof Modes again.

= Do Idle Session Logout (ISL) or Auth Cookie Expiration (ACE) affect all website visitors to your website? =

The Idle Session Logout (ISL) javascript code is only loaded if a User is logged into your website (depends on your ISL option settings for User Accounts/Roles) and is specific to only that User's Browser/Client Browser and Login Session. Auth Cookie Expiration (ACE) is a WordPress Authentication Cookie that is set when a User logs into your website. Visitors that visit your website that are not logged into your website are not affected in any way by ISL or ACE. 

= Can the Idle Session Logout Time be changed while Users are logged in or after a User has already logged in? =

Yes. ISL is Client Browser based and the Idle Session Logout Time is a variable that has a value that can be changed "on the fly". Example: If UserA and UserB login to your site and the Idle Session Logout Time was 60 minutes when they logged in and you change the Idle Session Logout Time to 1 minute while UserA and UserB are logged into your site then UserA and UserB and all other Users that are logged into your site (depending on your ISL option settings) will be automatically logged out after being idle/inactive for 1 minute.

= Can the Auth Cookie Expiration Time be changed while Users are logged in or after a User has already logged in? =

Yes and No. Yes, you can change the Auth Cookie Expiration Time option setting for all Users (depending on your ACE option settings), but the WordPress Authentication Cookie Expiration time is set when Users log into your site and cannot be changed "on the fly". So if you change the Auth Cookie Expiration Time while UserA and UserB are already logged into your site then the new Auth Cookie Expiration Time that you choose will not take effect until after UserA and UserB logout and log back into your site. The WordPress Authentication Cookie Expiration time can only be set/reset at login. This is the default functionality of the WordPress Authentication Cookie.

= How does BulletProof Security FrontEnd|BackEnd Maintenance Mode work? =

FrontEnd Maintenance Mode creates template files based on the options you choose and save. When you Turn On Maintenance Mode those template files are copied to the root directory of your website. When you Turn Off Maintenance Mode those template files are deleted from the root directory of your website. Maintenance Mode works by allowing the IP addresses that you enter & save to view the site normally. All other IP addresses will see the Maintenance Mode template page. BackEnd Maintenance Mode writes directly to your wp-admin .htaccess file and adds a deny all block of .htaccess code with the IP addresses the you enter & save when you enable BackEnd Maintenance Mode. When you disable/uncheck BackEnd Maintenance Mode that deny all block of .htaccess code is removed/deleted from your wp-admin .htaccess file. For more extensive help info or CSS Code, Image & Video Embed examples to add in the Maintenance Mode Text, CSS Style Code, Images, Videos Displayed To Website Visitors text area click this Maintenance Mode Guide Forum Topic link: <a href="https://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/topic/maintenance-mode-guide-read-me-first/" title="Maintenance Mode Guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Maintenance Mode Guide</a>.

= BPS Alert! Your site does not appear to be protected by BulletProof Security. What does the Alert mean? =

The alert means that the currently active root htaccess file that is in use on your website does not contain BPS htaccess security code. You can either run the Setup Wizard again or go to the htaccess File Options Security Modes page and click the Root Folder BulletProof Mode Activate button.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files? =

Yes. Add any additional custom htaccess security code to the BulletProof Security Custom Code feature. Your custom .htaccess code will be saved permanently to your database (until you delete it). Please view the Question Mark Help button in Custom Code for specific details and Custom Code setup steps.

= Does BulletProof Security automatically create or write .htaccess files? =

Yes. BulletProof Security automatically creates customized .htaccess website security files for your specific website with either the Setup Wizard or the manually by clicking the BulletProof Modes Activate buttons on the htaccess File Options Security Modes page. BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The BPS Master .htaccess files are pre-made. When you run the Setup Wizard or click the BulletProof Modes Activate buttons your .htaccess Master files are created with specific code for your specific website. You can add additional code to BPS Custom Code or edit the .htaccess files directly or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor or Custom Code - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required. Automation is great, but also having full manual editing control makes BulletProof Security very versatile.

= Security Log File Automation - Automatically Zipped, Emailed and Replaced =

Security Log files are automatically zipped, emailed and replaced with a new blank Security Log file when the log file reaches the maximum file size setting that you choose. By Default BulletProof Security sets this DB option to zip, email and replace the Security Log file when it reaches 500KB. The Security Log file is checked once per hour with a WordPress Cron. The optimum recommended file size setting is 500KB. Email and Log file settings are located under the Alerts|Logs|Email Options menu/page.

= MScan Malware Scanner Log File Automation - Automatically Zipped, Emailed and Replaced =

MScan Log files are automatically zipped, emailed and replaced with a new blank MScan Log file when the log file reaches the maximum file size setting that you choose. By Default BulletProof Security sets this DB option to zip, email and replace the MScan Log file when it reaches 500KB. The MScan Log file is checked once per hour with a WordPress Cron. The optimum recommended file size setting is 500KB. Email and Log file settings are located under the Alerts|Logs|Email Options menu/page.

= DB Backup Log File Automation - Automatically Zipped, Emailed and Replaced =

DB Backup Log files are automatically zipped, emailed and replaced with a new blank DB Backup Log file when the log file reaches the maximum file size setting that you choose. By Default BulletProof Security sets this DB option to zip, email and replace the Security Log file when it reaches 500KB. The DB Backup Log file is checked once per hour with a WordPress Cron. The optimum recommended file size setting is 500KB. Email and Log file settings are located under the Alerts|Logs|Email Options menu/page.

= What to do if Hidden Plugin Folders|Files Cron (HPF) detects a hidden plugin folder or file =

If a hidden or empty plugin folder is detected or a non-standard WP file is detected then you would use FTP to check the folder or file. If the folder or file contains hacker code or is a hidden plugin or is a non-standard WP file then make a copy of it and delete it. If the plugin folder is just an empty plugin folder then delete it. If you recognize the folder or file you can use the Ignore Hidden Plugin Folders & Files textarea box option to ignore/not check this folder or file.

= Does BulletProof Security work with Git distributed version control system? =

Yes. BulletProof Security works with Git, but does require some additional set up steps. Please see this thread for the setup steps
